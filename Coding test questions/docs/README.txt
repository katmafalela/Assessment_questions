# Development Environment Setup and Compilation Guide

This guide explains how to compile and run the source code for the piecewise recurrence relation problem using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and the MingW compiler.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode): [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- MingW compiler: [Download here](http://mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

## Development Environment Setup

1. Install Visual Studio Code by following the instructions on the official website.
2. Install the MingW compiler by downloading and running the installer.
3. Open VSCode and install the "C/C++" extension by Microsoft from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X). This extension provides C/C++ language support and debugging capabilities.

## Compilation and Running the Source Code

1. Open the source code file (e.g., `recurrence.c`) in VSCode.

2. Configure the VSCode tasks to compile and run the code:

   - Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette.
   - Type "Tasks: Configure Task" and select "Tasks: Configure Default Build Task".
   - Select "MingW" as the compiler if prompted.
   - Replace the content in the `tasks.json` file with the following:

     ```json
     {
         "version": "2.0.0",
         "tasks": [
             {
                 "label": "Build",
                 "type": "shell",
                 "command": "gcc",
                 "args": [
                     "-o",
                     "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
                     "${file}"
                 ],
                 "group": {
                     "kind": "build",
                     "isDefault": true
                 }
             },
             {
                 "label": "Run",
                 "type": "shell",
                 "command": "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
                 "group": "test"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

3. Save the `tasks.json` file.

4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B to compile the code. The output binary file will be created in the same directory as the source code file.

5. To run the program, press Ctrl+Shift+B again and select "Run" from the list of available tasks. The program output will be displayed in the integrated terminal of VSCode.

6. Adjust the value of `n` in the source code file (`recurrence.c`) to test different inputs for the recurrence relation.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should now be able to compile and run the source code for the piecewise recurrence relation problem using VSCode and the MingW compiler. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different values of `n` to explore the behavior of the recurrence relation.

If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please refer to the official documentation of VSCode and MingW or seek assistance from the respective communities.
